      "id": "REQ-5",
      "text": "After startup asset validation completes, present a blocking “Asset Scan Results” screen that lists each required asset filename (logo2.png, jacques-johnson.png, kream-kuntree.png, rl-stafford.png) and whether it was successfully detected/loaded, and require the user to explicitly continue before the theatre scene renders. If any required asset is missing, keep the existing strict missing-asset behavior (full-screen overlay with the exact message) and do not allow continuing.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On initial app load, the app performs the existing strict required-asset checks (fetch + image load) for the exact filenames: logo2.png, jacques-johnson.png, kream-kuntree.png, rl-stafford.png.",
        "If any asset is missing/unloadable, the app shows the existing MissingAssetOverlay with the exact text format already implemented and does not show the scan results screen.",
        "If all assets are present, a full-screen blocking overlay appears that lists all four filenames and indicates they were detected/loaded successfully.",
        "The theatre scene (BackgroundSilhouetteLogo, TheatreStageScene, CenteredHubLogo) does not render until the user clicks a clearly labeled Continue button on the scan results overlay.",
        "All user-facing text introduced for this feature is in English."

  ],
  "constraints": [
    "Do not modify any files under frontend/src/components/ui or any other paths listed in frontend.immutablePaths.",
    "Maintain the existing strict asset validation rules: exact filenames only; no placeholders; no substitutions; missing asset remains a blocking error overlay with the exact message format.",
    "Backend remains single-actor Motoko; no backend changes are required for this feature."
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Adding any new STEP 1 features beyond the asset scan listing/continue gate (e.g., ECG/heartbeat audio, carousels, artist cards, links, redirects).",
    "Implementing true runtime filesystem directory listing from the browser (only validation of known required filenames is in scope).",
    "Changing the existing theatre scene visuals or logo layering behaviors."
