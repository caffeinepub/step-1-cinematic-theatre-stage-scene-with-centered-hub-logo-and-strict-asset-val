        "On initial app load, the app performs the existing strict required-asset checks (fetch + image load) for the exact filenames: logo2.png, jacques-johnson.png, kream-kuntree.png, rl-stafford.png.",
        "If any asset is missing/unloadable, the app shows the existing MissingAssetOverlay with the exact text format already implemented and does not show the scan results screen.",
        "If all assets are present, a full-screen blocking overlay appears that lists all four filenames and indicates they were detected/loaded successfully.",
        "The theatre scene (BackgroundSilhouetteLogo, TheatreStageScene, CenteredHubLogo) does not render until the user clicks a clearly labeled Continue button on the scan results overlay.",
        "All user-facing text introduced for this feature is in English."

Ensure the theatre scene components do not render at all before Continue."
