      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "The centered hub logo still references only src \"/logo2-1.png\" and does not introduce any references to \"/logo2.png\" or other filenames.",
        "There is an explicit, deterministic code path that unmounts and remounts the hub logo image element (remove + reinsert) to rebind the asset.",
        "No visual/layout/styling changes occur to the hub logo or halo ring: same size, same centering, same z-index layering, same shadows/filters, same pointer-events behavior.",
        "Existing asset validation, Asset Scan Results gating, and missing-asset enforcement behavior remains unchanged."
