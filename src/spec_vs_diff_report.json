  "summary": "REQ-5 is largely implemented: the app performs strict startup validation for the four exact filenames, shows the existing MissingAssetOverlay on failure, otherwise presents a blocking “Asset Scan Results” overlay listing the assets and requiring a Continue click before rendering the theatre scene. One additional unrequested behavior (a Loading... screen) was introduced.",

      "description": "Introduced an explicit full-screen “Loading...” overlay while asset checks run.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest does not ask for a loading screen; it only specifies behavior for missing-asset overlay vs. scan results overlay gating the scene.",

        "frontend/src/App.tsx (isChecking branch renders Loading...)"
