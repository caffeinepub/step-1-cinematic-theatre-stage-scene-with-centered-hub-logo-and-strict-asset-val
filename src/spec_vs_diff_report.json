  "summary": "Updated both the center hub logo and background silhouette logo components to use a centralized constant pointing to `logo2-1.png`, but the diff does not provide enough evidence to confirm that `logo2.png` is no longer referenced anywhere else in the project. An additional unrequested \"two-phase render\" remount behavior was introduced for the hub logo image.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Do not reference `logo2.png` anywhere in the project for these logo bindings.",
      "reason": "The diff shows the two logo components now use `logo2-1.png` via a shared constant, but it does not show a repo-wide removal or audit of other potential `logo2.png` references (only a small set of files are shown/modified, and content is truncated).",

    {
      "description": "Deterministic two-phase render that unmounts/remounts the hub logo image on mount (\"asset rebinding\" via React key/state).",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest only asked to swap logo asset bindings to use `logo2-1.png` and avoid `logo2.png` references; it did not request adding a remount/rebinding mechanism.",
